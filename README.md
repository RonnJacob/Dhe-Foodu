#Dhe Puttu

###About The Project

The website is titled 'Dhe Foodu' - malayalam slang for Food is Here and aims to be an
online restaurant finding service for the city of Kozhikode. The service enables you to 
find a restaurant of your choice based on two parameters - location and cuisine. We have
also incorporated a **Surprise Me** button, similar to the **I'm Feeling Lucky** button on Google. 
The data is sourced from the respective websites of the restaurants, TripAdvisor and Google, 
and is hosted on Athena.

Designed by *Sreeraag Mohan* and *Ronn Jacob*.
