# Dhe Puttu

### About The Project

The website is titled 'Dhe Foodu' - malayalam slang for Food is Here and aims to be an
online restaurant finding service for the city of Kozhikode. The service enables you to 
find a restaurant of your choice based on two parameters - location and cuisine. We have
also incorporated a *Surprise Me* button, similar to the *I'm Feeling Lucky* button on Google. 
The data is sourced from the respective websites of the restaurants, TripAdvisor and Google, 
and is hosted on Athena.

### This would be the landing page.
Here we'll be able to make our area and cuisine selection. Appropriate results will be shown according
to these parameters

### This is how the results would like when you click 'Submit'.
